#SuperSonic Audiobook Player

SuperSonic Audiobook Player (SAP) is a minimalist audiobook player built on the fantastic library sonic, portAudio, and libsndfile.
This is the minimal command line version. You simply give it a file to play, -s <speed> specifies the playback speed, and that's the gist of it. 
I'm currently working on a more fully featured audiobook player and audiobook manager built on curses, and another version that will be built into
an apk, both of which will also go in this repo.
